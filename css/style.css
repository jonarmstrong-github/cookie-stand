/* Developer Style Guide
    In addition to the requirements listed above, please ensure that your project also contains the following according to our style guide:

    For every lab within this project, you will be creating a new branch for every day. Create a new branch name that follows the following format class##-feature (example: class06-Objects).

    Within your local version of your repo, add your .gitignore and .eslintrc.json.

    While working within your non-main branch, conduct regular commits within git.

    All properties/values and methods should be correctly constructed and given meaningful names.

    Functions and methods should follow the single-responsibility principle.

    Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page
